### For typing practice
Take `output.txt` and use it as a custom text in [Monkeytype](www.monkeytype.com) with `random` setting.

### Nerd shit
This is a python script that accepts 4 input files:
1. bigrams.txt
2. trigrams.txt
3. tetragrams.txt
4. words.txt

The files should be sorted such that the ones that you want most in the final result are at the top.
For all 4 files I had them sorted by popularity, so I ended up with 200 popular words containing popular ngrams.
